# MILOS

- My attempt to make an Arch-based distro with a classic MacOS WhiteSur look
- Using Calamares for an installer, with the classic WhiteSur-gtk-theme (both TBD)
- Has a liveboot feature (added on 04/02/2024)
- The main pacman repo can be found in 

Uses:
- Calamares (TBD)
- https://github.com/vinceliuice/WhiteSur-gtk-theme.git (TBD)
- https://github.com/vinceliuice/WhiteSur-icon-theme.git (TBD)
- 

Inspired from: 
- [Arch Linux Calamares Installer/ALCI](https://github.com/arch-linux-calamares-installer/alci-iso.git) (TBD)
- [Arch Linux GNOME Live ISO](https://github.com/n0raitor/archlinux-iso/tree/main)
    - Mainly used for the gnome live boot, which was a tad bit of a hassle to setup
