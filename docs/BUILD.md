# How to build the iso
- First setup the Chaotic Aur using the instructions found on their website: [Chaotic Aur](https://aur.chaotic.cx/)
- Download archiso, so as to get mkarchiso, then (if memory allows), you can run `mkarchiso -v -w /tmp/archiso-tmp -o ./out ./fuji-builder` (as the command will tell you, this needs to be run as root, so sudo away!)
